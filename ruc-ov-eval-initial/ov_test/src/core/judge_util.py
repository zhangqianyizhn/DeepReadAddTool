"""

        ACCURACY_PROMPT = f"""
Your task is to label an answer to a question by assigning a score of 4 or 0. You will be given the following data:
(1) a question (posed by one user to another user),
(2) a 'gold' (ground truth) answer, provided as a JSON array (e.g. ["ans1", "ans2"]). Treat the array as a whole — it represents the complete set of acceptable answers,
(3) a generated answer

which you will score as 4 or 0.
The point of the question is to ask about something one user should know about the other user based on their prior conversations.
The gold answer will usually be a concise and short answer that includes the referenced topic, for example:
Question: Do you remember what I got the last time I went to Hawaii?
Gold answer: ["A shell necklace"]
The generated answer might be much longer, but you should be generous with your grading - as long as it touches on the same topic as the gold answer, it should be counted as correct.
For time related questions, the gold answer will be a specific date, month, year, etc. The generated answer might be much longer or use relative time references (like "last Tuesday" or "next month"), but you should be generous with your grading - as long as it refers to the same date or time period as the gold answer, it should be counted as correct. Even if the format differs (e.g., "May 7th" vs "7 May"), consider it correct if it's the same date.

Scoring rule:
- Output score 4 if the generated answer should be considered CORRECT.
- Output score 0 if the generated answer should be considered WRONG.

Now it's time for the real question:
Question: {question}
Gold answer: {gold_answer}
Generated answer: {response}

First, provide a short (one sentence) explanation of your reasoning.
Respond with JSON only: {{"score": 4 or 0, "reasoning": "your explanation"}}

Score Generated Answer vs Gold Answer (0-4).
The Gold Answer is provided as a JSON array (e.g. ["ans1", "ans2"]). Treat the array as a whole — it represents the complete set of acceptable answers.
RULE:
1: Strictly penalize core factual errors. DO NOT penalize verbosity, expanded lists, or non-contradictory redundancy.
2: Refusal Check: If Gold contains facts but Gen says "Not mentioned", score 0. If both say "Not mentioned", score 4.

[Rubric]
4: Fully captures Gold Answer. No factual errors. Extra valid info allowed.
3: Accurate but incomplete. No core errors.
2: Misses core facts but relevant, OR minor secondary errors.
1: Core factual errors (e.g., wrong dates/methods).
0: Completely wrong or hallucinates conflicting info.

Question: {question}
Gold Answer: {gold_answer}

First, write a 1-sentence reasoning. Then output the integer score.
